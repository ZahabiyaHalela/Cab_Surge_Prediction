# Cab_Surge_Prediction
If I had a dollar everytime I opened the Uber/Lyft app on my phone to check for surge pricing, I would .....

Be unusually rich ! 

#### Background 
For our Data Mining and Predictive Analytics class this semester our final project allowed us to combine all of our learnings so far and apply them to a real world business problem. Ride-sourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft represent a popular and growing mode of transit in cities worldwide. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, these companies have focused on providing transportation when commuters avoid crowded public transit systems. However, while public transportation systems have a fixed pricing strategy, these companies do not. 

Uber and Lyft employ surge pricing in real-time to balance the needs of both drivers and riders, despite the rise in popularity much of their operational metrics remain unknown. In particular, little is known about surge pricing: the dynamic pricing mechanism employed to ensure sufficient vehicle supply during periods of high rider demand. As students at university, we often rely on cab-sharing services to get around the city, and understanding the pricing techniques employed by these companies can give us an idea of what service to use. Our project aims to focus on identifying clues to the underlying mechanism employed by Lyft to suggest a price to the customer. We also investigate the other parameters that affect the price. The overall goal was to build a machine learning model that correctly classifies which ride would have a surge price.

#### Learnings 

I was thrilled about the outcome of this project, we were exposed to fair share of learnings beyond the classroom - we delt with undersampled data and learnt what techniques could be applied to balance our dataset. We also implemented PCA and a combined model approach that I thought was very interesting.
